            <h2>Top Study Tips</h2>
            <ul class="tips-list">
                <li>
                    <h3>1. Focused vs. Diffuse Thinking</h3>
                    <p>Alternate between focused attention and relaxed, diffuse thinking. This helps you form connections between ideas and enhance your problem-solving abilities.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>2. Spaced Repetition</h3>
                    <p>Review material over increasingly spaced intervals. This technique, known as spaced repetition, has been shown to improve long-term retention of information.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>3. Practice Retrieval</h3>
                    <p>Testing yourself on material, rather than just re-reading it, strengthens memory and understanding. Use quizzes and flashcards to practice retrieval.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>4. Chunking Information</h3>
                    <p>Group related pieces of information together. Chunking helps you process complex information more easily by organizing it into meaningful categories.</p>
